# BulbSwitcherApp

## Description

**BulbSwitcherApp** is a simple interactive web application that allows users to toggle a bulb on and off. The app switches between two states when the user interacts with the on/off buttons:
- When switched **on**, the bulb lights up, and the cat appears normally.
- When switched **off**, the bulb goes dark, and the cat's eyes are glowing to indicate the bulb is off.

This project demonstrates how to manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript to change images, text, and button colors based on user interaction.

## Features
- Toggle the bulb on and off.
- Change the bulb image when switched on and off.
- Change the cat image depending on the bulb state.
- Display the switch status (On or Off).
- Change the button colors based on the bulb state.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The HTML structure of the page, including the bulb image, cat image, buttons, and status text.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing the styling for the page, including button colors and image alignment.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript logic for switching the bulb on/off, changing the images, and updating the button styles.

## How It Works

- **Switch On**: When the user clicks the "On" switch:
  - The bulb turns on and the bulb image changes.
  - The cat image switches to the normal state.
  - The status text displays **"Switched On"**.
  - Button colors change to indicate the active switch.

- **Switch Off**: When the user clicks the "Off" switch:
  - The bulb turns off, and the bulb image changes.
  - The cat image switches to a glowing-eyed state.
  - The status text displays **"Switched Off"**.
  - Button colors change to indicate the active switch.
